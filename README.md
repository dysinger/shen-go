# Shen/Go, a Go port of the Shen language

Shen is a portable functional programming language by [Mark Tarver](http://marktarver.com) that offers

- pattern matching,
- λ calculus consistency,
- macros,
- optional lazy evaluation,
- static type checking,
- an integrated fully functional Prolog,
- and an inbuilt compiler-compiler.

shen-go is a port of the Shen language that runs on top of Go implementations.

There is a klambda interpreter that is basically done, but it's quite slow. Right now I'm working on a bytecode compiler.

## Building

Make sure you [have Go installed](https://golang.org/doc/install).

```
go get github.com/tiancaiamao/shen-go/cmd/kl
```

## Running

```
$GOPATH/bin/kl -shen
```
